The Hadamard Matrix (from Sedgewick and Wayne).
===================

The N-by-N Hadamard matrix H(N) is a boolean matrix with the
remarkable property that any two rows differ in exaclty N/2 entries.
(This property makes it useful for designing error-correcting codes.)
H(1) is a 1-by-1 matrix with the single entry true and for N > 1,
H(2N) is obtained by aligning four copies of H(N) in a large square,
and then inverting all of the entries in the lower right N-by-N copy,
as shown in the following examples (with T representing true and F
representing false).


H(1)
====
T

H(2)
====
T T
T F

H(4)
====
T T T T
T F T F
T T F F
T F F T

Write a program that takes one command-line argument N and prints H(N).
Assume that N is a power of 2.


public class Hadamard{

       private boolean _mat;

       // constructor
       // precondition : n is a power of 2
       public Hadamard(int n){
         // your code goes here
       }

       // postcondition: prints the Hadamard matrix
       //                use T for true, F for false
       public String toString(){

       }

       // You can create other methods that are used in the constructor.



}
