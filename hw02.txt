Due: Mon., 2/6

1. Given

     public static int mult(int a, int b){
     	    if (b == 0) return 0;
	    if (b % 2 == 0) return mult(a+a, b/2);
	    return mult(a+a, b/2) + a;
     }

 a. Draw a trace diagram for mult(3,12).

	mult(6, 6) 
	mult(12, 3) 
	mult(24, 1) + 12
	mult(48, 0) + 24
	36

 b. What is the exptected runtime of the mult(int,int) function?

n represents b
log n is cut in half each time

	O(log n)

2. In the classwork folder, review the NumToEng.java program.
   This program currently translates an integer between 0 and 10
   to its English equivalent.

   Extend the program to translate an integer between 0 and 100 to
   its English equivalent.

   See output100.txt for the expeced results.
