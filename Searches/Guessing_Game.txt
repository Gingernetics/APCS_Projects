Finish writing the program GuessingGame.

The program asks the user to pick a number from 1 to N.
The computer then tries to guess the number with the minimum number
of guesses. After each guess, the user guides the program by
typing one of the following:

    - "c" if the guess is correct.
    - "l" if the guess is too low.
    - "h" if the guess is too high.


At the end of the game, report how many guesses were made. Also
determine, when possible, if the user has lied.
