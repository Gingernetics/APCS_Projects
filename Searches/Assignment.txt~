Due: Thurs. 12/08

1. Review the code in Searches.java.

2. Consider the array:

     1,5,9,12,15,21,29,31


    where the binarySearch() function from Searches.java is performed
    on the array.

   Trace the values of the variables lowerBound, upperBound and middle
   for each of the following keys.
		lowerBound | upperBound | middle
  a. 5		0		8		4
		0		4		2
		0		2		1		
			return 1	
	
  b. 13		0		8		4
		5		8		6
		5		6		5
		4		5		4
		4		4		

			return -1

  c. 16		0		8		4
		5		8		6
		5		6		5
		5		5
			return -1	


3. Given this unordered array:

     12,21,5,9,1,31,29,15


    If a binarySearch is performed on this array, which of the keys
    can be found?

		5, 29


4. If an array is sorted in descending order and the binarySearch method
   from Searches.java is performed, which key(s), if any, can be located?

		Center element, assuming an odd number of elements




5. Write the static method log2(int n) that returns the number of times
   the integer n can be divided in half until it reaches 1. This function
   should return an integer.

    ex. log2(8) -> 3
        log2(0) -> 1
	log2(7) -> 1

	public static int log2(int n){
		int i = 0;
		while (!(n/2 == 0)){
			i++;
			n /= 2;
		}
	return i;
	}

6. Compute log2(Integer.MAX_VALUE).
			29

7. Given an array of N objects that are sorted in ascending order,
   determine the maximum number of times the while loop will be executed?


8. When will this occur?
