Write a program to simulate an ecosystem containing two types of creatures,
bears and fish. The ecosystem consists of a river, which is modeled as
a relatively large array. Each cell of the array should contain an Animal
object, which can be a Bear object, a Fish object, or null. In each step,
bears and fish attempt to move into adjacent array cells or they can stay
where they are, at random. Use actual object creation, via the new operator,
to model the creation of new objects, and provide a visualization of the array
after each time step.






1.  Create classes Animal, Bear, Fish, and Ecosystem.
    Make the Animal class abstract.

    Use the following is a relationships:
    Bear is an Animal
    Fish is an Animal
    
    Use the following has a relationship:
    Animal has an Ecosystem such that each Animal keeps track
    of its river and position in the river.

  
2. Attributes of the Ecosystem:
 
    Animal[] _river
    int _populationSize // represents the number of animals in the river

3. Capablities of the Ecosystem are listed below:

    // constructor
    Ecosystem(int capacity, int numFish, int numBear)   

     
    // accessor methods
    public Animal[] getRiver()  // returns the river
    public boolean isFull() // returns true if the river cannot accomodate a new Animal
    public int getRandomPos() // returns -1 if the river is full otherwise returns a random open position



    // mutator methods
    public void step() // asks each animal in the river to move
    //  example :    |__F___B__|   where F represents a Fish, B a Bear
    // step() might look like : |__F__B___|
    // step() might look like : |_F__B____|



    // overriden methods
    public String toString() // prints the ecosystem 


4. Attributes of an Animal:
    
    Ecosystem _eco
    int _pos // represents the position of the Animal in the river

5. Capabilities of an Animal
   
    Animal(Ecosystem eco, int pos) // constructor
 

6. Capablities of a Bear
     
    Bear (Ecosystem eco, int pos)
    // override the toString method
    public String toString()

7. Capablities of a Fish
   
   Fish (Ecosystem eco, int pos)
 
   public String toString()
